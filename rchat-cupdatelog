rchat 1.3 changes:
- Fix stupid problem where files are saved to /tmp meaning they're reset on every reboot. This means:
  - Auto updating will not work properly. With this release, rchat will no longer complain if you already picked "never" or "ignore".
  - Instances now save properly.
  - Potentially other issues are resolved.
