Title: rchat can now be downloaded and installed using package managers
Date: 24/04/2022

Yes, that's right. rchat is now available for download through the Arch Linux AUR if you're using Arch Linux or any distributions based on it.
It's also available on Gentoo through my overlay. If you wanna add my overlay and install rchat, run the following command as root:

'layman -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spoverlay/splay/main/splay.xml -f -a splay'

Then you can just 'emerge rchat' like any other package.
For Arch Linux, you'll install it like any other AUR package or using an AUR helper. If you're using yay,

'yay -S rchat'

Do not run it as root. That's it, have a good day!
